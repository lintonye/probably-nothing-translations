### 正在开发我们的 ERC-20 代币

正如我们在创刊中所宣布的那样，允许访问我们的 Discord 的 Devs 4 Revolution NFT 很快售罄，并且 D_D 暂时不接受新成员。

我们正在努力研究将取代 NFT 的 ERC-20 治理代币的代币经济学，您很快就会看到提案。 目的是让新的 ERC-20 代币为那些未能购买 NFT 的人开辟一条进入社区的途径，使我们能够以可持续和包容的方式扩展为 DAO，并奖励 贡献者。

我们还在讨论是否向所有人开放一些 Discord 频道，例如那些涉及公共产品对话的频道。

Initial DAO Treasury deployed
We launched a critical piece of DAO infrastructure and deployed our Treasury as a multisig contract wallet.

The role of the Treasury will be to store the assets of the DAO, which will include allocations of our ERC-20 token once it launches as well as on-chain revenues and tokens from partnerships.

The Treasury setup requires that 3 out of the 6 multisig wallet signers sign a transaction for funds to be spent, and the initial signers will serve for the first two seasons. This will give the DAO time to improve our governance and tooling processes, so that we can move to a more decentralized Treasury over time.

Partnership with Gitcoin
We announced a proposal for partnership and mutual grant with Gitcoin, one of the most prominent communities in web3.

Gitcoin’s objective is to build and fund the open web, which aligns well with our mission to educate a new wave of web3 builders. They also bring substantial experience establishing and growing a DAO that will be invaluable as we ourselves scale.

In numbers, the proposal is that 5% of the D_D governance token (when live) will be allocated to Gitcoin in exchange for 50,000 GTC, Gitcoin’s native token.

Don’t forget to get involved in the proposal discussion and vote!

Good vibes only
As more people join our community, we want to make sure that it remains a fun and harassment-free corner of the internet.

If you feel like you’ve been harassed or have witnessed harassment, please fill out D_D’s anonymous harassment reporting form.
